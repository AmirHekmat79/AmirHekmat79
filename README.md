### Hi there 👋
My name is AmirHossein and I'm a Frontend developer who primarily works with modern Frontend Tools and libraries.
I studied Computer Engineering at Shahrood university of technology and this made my way more clear and easy.
I have experiences as a Frontend Developer in some corporations and I worked with my colleages in some projects.
I still try to improve my skills and learn new features in Frontend Development such as modern libraries or frameworks.
I enjoy designing and developing projects.
🔥❤️💻
